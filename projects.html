                <h1>Air Defense</h1>
                <p>
                    Air Defense is a game I made for iPad. It is a modern take on the Atari game Missile Game.
                    This was my senior project in my high school's two year long Honors Programming Course sequence. 
                    As part of the requirements for the project I had to present what I made in front of a group of 
                    industry professionals.

                <h1>Snake</h1>
                <p>
                    I made the majority of this project while I was bored during Winter break.
